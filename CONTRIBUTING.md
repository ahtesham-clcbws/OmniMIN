## 📘 Documentation & Rules

We maintain a strict set of architectural rules and workflows to ensure code quality and consistency. The single source of truth for all development guidelines is located in the `.agent` directory.

**👉 Please read [`.agent/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](.agent/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) before starting any work.**

This guide covers:
- **Rules**: Strict typing, component structure, and git conventions.
- **Workflows**: How to set up, build, and debug the project.
- **Architecture**: Backend API and UI patterns.

## Quick Start
1.  Read the instructions linked above.
2.  Run `npm run tauri dev` to start the development environment.
3.  Follow the [New Feature Workflow](.agent/workflows/new_feature.md) for any UI additions.
