# Agent Persistence & Context Preservation

## Rule
**Every agent session must be logged and saved into `.agent/ProjectInfo/agent_logs/` to ensure infinite context preservation.**

## Requirements

### 1. Session Logging
- **Frequency**: At the end of every major task or session.
- **Location**: `.agent/ProjectInfo/agent_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_TaskName.md`.
- **Content**:
    - **Goal**: What was the objective?
    - **Changes**: Summary of files modified and key decisions.
    - **Next Steps**: What should the next agent do?
    - **Artifacts**: Links to any diagrams or plans created.

### 2. Artifact Storage
- Any diagram, schema, or extensive plan generated by the agent must be saved in `.agent/ProjectInfo/artifacts/`.
- **Do not** leave important context solely in the chat history.

### 3. Task Tracker
- Always update `.agent/ProjectInfo/task.md` to reflect the latest status.
- Mark completed items with `[x]` and add new sub-tasks if discovered.

## Why?
This ensures that if the chat history is lost or a new agent takes over, they can reconstruct the project state from the file system alone.
